# exam-scheduling
The current manual process of creating the final exam schedule at Rice University's registrar's office is both time-consuming for staff and problematic for students. Every semester, it takes more than 8 hours to come up with a
schedule, which usually has shortcomings that negatively impact the student experience. For example, it can lead to an unfair distribution of exams, where some students have to take multiple exams on the same day, while others have 
more time to prepare and relax. In other cases, it can cause inconvenience for students who are forced to remain on campus for an extra week only to take one exam. Additionally, scheduling exams in inconvenient classrooms can cause
undue stress for both faculty and students, leading to numerous requests for exam time rescheduling and classroom changes.

Every student requesting an exam reschedule can cost instructors around 3 hours of their time. With Rice University's undergraduate population exceeding 4480, these inefficiencies and time losses can become a significant problem.
Therefore, it is critical that Rice University adopt a more efficient and student-friendly approach to creating the final exam schedule. By doing so, the university can improve the overall student experience while saving valuable time and
resources for both students and faculty.

This project proposes a schedule generation algorithm that uses mixed integer programming techniques to find an
optimal, or near-optimal solution.
